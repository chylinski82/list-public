# The List

The List is a dynamic list manager, where various users on multiple devices have simultaneous access to lists, like a shopping list, for which this web app is ideal. It is connected to an external database, so while one user updates the list, others see those changes in real time.

Though "The List" was made mainly for smartphone users, it's fully responsive and works great on all devices. This is a fully functional demo version featuring two lists: shopping list and to do list, feel free to play around.

This project is developed with ReactJS, Firestore, and CSS.

## Installation

To use the app, simply go to [http://thelists.surge.sh](http://thelists.surge.sh) and start adding items to the shopping or to do list.

## Usage

By clicking on the gear icon, you can have access to additional features like marking items as important or unimportant, which will be reflected in the different background color of an item. You can also move items either to the top or bottom of the list, and add comments.

## Known Issues

There may be some minor glitches that do not impact the usage of the app.

## Contribute

This is an open project, and anyone is welcome to manipulate the lists as it is mainly to showcase my work. If you would like to enjoy a personal version for your own use, don't hesitate to contact me at [k.chylinski@gmail.com](mailto:k.chylinski@gmail.com) and I'll be happy to help.
